This is the write up for a research project undertaken at Imperial College London's Centre for Neurotechnology in 2020, which aimed to produce an algorithm that can robustly make decisions on the existence of motor units from sEMG signals, even in contexts with high noise.

The provided code has been manipulated since the results published in this report were taken. Therefore, whilst it gives an idea of the work taken, simply running it won't return the results in the paper.
